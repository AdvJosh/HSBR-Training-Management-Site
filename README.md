The git repo for the HSBR Forbes travel guide training website

This is mainly built as a person project for my job, but I need it to be public to use it in Replit because I am too cheap to pay for a licence. Maybe you can learn from it too, but don't expect to much as this is my first acutal Flask web app.  

Just as a side legal note, I am in no way supported or endorsed by Forbes or Forbes Travel Guide. All trademarks are property of their respective leagl owners.
