# hsbr-forbes-training-portal
The git repo for the HSBR Forbes travel guide training website

  This is mainly built as a person project for my job, but I need it to be public to use it in Replit because I am too cheap to pay for a licence. That being said, I am also a huge believer in free and open source software so I love to make everything that I can public for others to use. Maybe you can learn from it too, but don't expect to much as this is my first acutal Flask web app.

  If you're reading this, and you actually care, I would love to hear your thoughts on what I could do to improve this web app. I am planning to refactor this into a general training app at some point for me to use for my job. I will likely repurpose this code base for that end by renaming the repo and pulling my final commit for this base app into its own branch.

Want to see all the suff I want to add here? Check out the todo.txt! If you want to make my day, you could try and help me implement some of the things in there. If you want to contribute, I can set you up with sample data out of the DB to test implimenting things.
