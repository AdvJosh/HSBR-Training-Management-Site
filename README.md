# hsbr-forbes-training-portal
The git repo for the HSBR training portal website

  This is mainly built as a personal project for my job, but I am also a huge believer in free and open source software so I love to make everything that I can public for others to use. Maybe you can learn from it too, but don't expect to much as this is my first acutal Flask web app. I am contenuosly developing it, so expect many changes.

  If you're reading this, and you actually care, I would love to hear your thoughts on what I could do to improve this web app or my programing. I am currently trying to refactor this into a general training app for me to use for my job.

Want to see all the suff I want to add here? Check out the todo.txt! If you want to make my day, you could try and help me implement some of the things in there. If you want to contribute, I can set you up with sample data out of the DB to test implimenting things.
