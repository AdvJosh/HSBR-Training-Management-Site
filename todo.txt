A list of improvements I should make:
* A Spanish locale for the site
* More secure session/login management
* Admin access based on the database
* Admin Tool - edit class information
* Admin Tool - Update Session Sign in information
* A different admin header tool bar
* An admin landing page
* Incorporate the associates name into the pages
* Make the admin/no-access page pretty
* Show sessions that they were not signed up for but did complete in the "My Sesssions" page
* Impliment Flask blueprints for better future ussage of this site.
